#  Longest Consecutive Sequence

>Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

### Sample Input

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]

### Sample Output

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

### Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>

-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>
