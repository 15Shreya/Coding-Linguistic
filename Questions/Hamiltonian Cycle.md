# Hamiltonian Cycle using Backtracking

> The Hamiltonian cycle is the cycle in the graph which visits all the vertices in graph exactly once and terminates at the starting node. It may not include all the edges

### Problem Statement:
The Hamiltonian cycle problem is the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a given  connected
undirected Graph G of n vertices using backtracking principle.

### Example

Consider the following undirected graph G with '5' vertices.

For the graph shown above, a path (A – B – E – D – C – A) forms a Hamiltonian cycle.
