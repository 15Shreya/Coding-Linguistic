# Convex Hull using Divide and Conquer Method

> The convex hull of the set of points Q is the convex polygon P that encompasses all of the points given. The problem of finding the smallest polygon P such that all the points of set Q are either on the boundary of P or inside P is known 
> as the convex hull problem. 

Input is an array of points specified by their x and y coordinates. The output is the convex hull of this set of points. Examples:

### Sample Input
Input : points[] = {(0, 0), (0, 4), (-4, 0), (5, 0), 
                   (0, -6), (1, 0)};

### Sample Output
Output : (-4, 0), (5, 0), (0, -6), (0, 4)
